### Chapter 7 - Exercise 5

a) $\hat{g}_2$ will have a smaller training RSS since the model has more degrees of freedom, thus producing a more flexible model.

b) $\hat{g}_1$ will probably have a smaller test RSS since $\hat{g}_2$ might overfit due to its high flexibility.

c) They'll have the same training and test RSS since $\lambda$ will be so small that both $\hat{g}_1$ and $\hat{g}_2$ will be nearly identical.
